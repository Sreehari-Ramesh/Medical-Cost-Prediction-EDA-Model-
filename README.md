# Medical-Cost-Prediction-EDA-Model-
This isThe dataset used in this analysis is a medical cost personal dataset, which contains information about the medical costs billed to patients based on various factors such as their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region of residence. The dataset consists of 1338 instances and 7 features, making it a relatively small and manageable dataset.

In this analysis, I have conducted a thorough exploration of the medical cost personal dataset to gain insights into the factors that influence medical costs. We started by preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, and categorical variables. We then used various types of plots to visualize the distribution of each feature and examine the relationship between different pairs of features.

Next, we performed regression analysis to analyze the correlation between features and the target variable, which is the medical costs billed to patients. We built several regression models using different algorithms, including linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, and random forest regression,decision tree regressor to predict the medical costs of patients based on their other characteristics and evaluated the performance of each model.
